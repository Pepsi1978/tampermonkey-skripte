- Target Windows 10+ with WPF for desktop apps
- Use MVVM pattern with CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
- Always include proper app.manifest for DPI awareness and admin elevation
- Build with: `dotnet build -c Release`
- Publish self-contained: `dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained`
- Follow Fluent Design System for modern Windows UI
