# Self-Improve: Systematic Environment Optimization

You are performing a systematic self-improvement of your development environment. This is not a one-shot check — you run **3 improvement loops**, each time digging deeper. Think of it like polishing: each pass reveals new things to fix.

The user is not a programmer. Explain everything in German, in simple terms, so they understand what you did and why.

## Visibility Rules (CRITICAL)

- **NEVER run anything in the background** (no `context: fork`, no `run_in_background`, no silent subagents)
- The user MUST be able to read along with EVERY action in real-time
- Each action gets its own visible output line that stays on screen — never overwrite previous output
- Before each action, write a short German explanation of what you're about to do
- After each action, write the result so the user can follow the progress
- Think of it as a live protocol: the user reads along like watching a log file

## User Goals (never forget these)

- **Zero friction**: No permission prompts, no manual steps, full automation
- **Maximum quality**: Store-quality native apps for macOS (Swift/AppKit) and Windows (C#/WPF)
- **Preferred languages**: Swift, C#, TypeScript, Rust, Go (in this order). No Python for visible things.
- **Best model always**: Opus with high effort and extended thinking
- **Parallel execution**: Use Agent Teams and subagents wherever possible — BUT always in the main conversation, never hidden
- **Self-explanatory**: Always explain what you did and why, in German

## The 3-Loop Process

For each loop (1, 2, 3), execute ALL 5 phases. Each loop should find progressively subtler improvements.

### Phase 1: CHECK (Audit)

Run a comprehensive audit. Use parallel tool calls for speed.

**Check these in parallel:**
- `claude --version` — is Claude Code itself up to date?
- `brew outdated` — any Homebrew packages need updating?
- `rustup check` — Rust toolchain updates?
- `dotnet workload update --check` — .NET workload updates?
- Read `~/.claude/settings.json` — verify all settings are optimal
- Read `~/CLAUDE.md` — verify rules are current and complete
- List `~/.claude/rules/` — check all rule files for accuracy
- List `~/.claude/agents/` — verify all agents use `model: opus`
- List `~/.claude/commands/` — check custom commands
- Read `~/.claude/projects/-Users-frank/memory/MEMORY.md` — is memory accurate?
- Count enabled plugins in settings.json — compare against known available plugins
- Check `~/.zshrc` — verify PATH and aliases are correct
- Run `git config --global --list` — verify git settings
- Check disk space with `df -h /`

**Collect all findings into a status report before proceeding.**

### Phase 2: RESEARCH (Discover New Things)

Use WebSearch and WebFetch to find improvements. Run these searches in parallel via subagents:

1. **Claude Code updates**: Search for "Claude Code new features" or "Claude Code changelog" — any new settings, flags, or capabilities?
2. **Plugin marketplace**: Fetch the superpowers-marketplace catalog and the official plugins — any new plugins since last check?
3. **Skills and best practices**: Search for "Claude Code skills best practices" or "Claude Code optimization" — any new techniques?
4. **Language tooling**: Check if there are newer versions of key tools (Xcode, .NET SDK, Rust, Go, Node, Bun)
5. **Security**: Any known vulnerabilities in installed tools?

**Important**: Only suggest installing things that align with the user's goals. Don't suggest Python tools or frameworks unless they're invisible backend components.

### Phase 3: UPDATE (Apply Updates)

Based on findings from CHECK and RESEARCH:

- Run `brew upgrade` if packages are outdated (but skip Python-related packages)
- Run `rustup update` if Rust has updates
- Update plugins if new versions exist
- Fix any settings that have drifted from optimal
- Update rule files if language versions changed
- Update memory file if information is outdated
- Install any new plugins or tools discovered in RESEARCH phase

**Always explain what you're updating and why before doing it.**

### Phase 4: IMPROVE (Optimize Beyond Updates)

This is the creative phase. Think about:

- Can any rule files be improved with new best practices?
- Are there new agent types that would be useful?
- Can the CLAUDE.md be refined for better automation?
- Are there new hooks that would reduce friction?
- Can build/test/deploy workflows be streamlined?
- Are there new cross-compilation targets worth adding?
- Can the quality loop (build → test → review → improve) be made more automatic?

**Implement at least one concrete improvement per loop, even if small.**

### Phase 5: REPORT (Explain in German)

After each loop, give a **detailed** summary. The user must understand exactly what changed and why.

```
## Verbesserungsschleife [N]/3

### Was ich geprüft habe
[kurze Liste aller Checks]

### Was ich aktualisiert habe
[JEDE einzelne Änderung mit Dateiname/Pfad und Begründung]
Beispiel:
- `~/.claude/rules/rust.md` → MinGW-Hinweis hinzugefügt, weil Cross-Compilation jetzt aktiv
- `~/.claude/agents/debugger.md` → LSP-Tools hinzugefügt für bessere Fehlersuche

### Was ich verbessert habe
[konkrete Verbesserungen mit Begründung — was war vorher, was ist jetzt]

### Was ich NICHT geändert habe (und warum)
[wichtige Entscheidungen, etwas bewusst nicht zu ändern]

### Status
[Gesamtstatus der Umgebung]
```

**Transparenz-Regel**: Keine stille Änderung. Jede Datei, jede Einstellung, jeder Befehl der geändert wird, muss im Report erscheinen.

## After All 3 Loops: Phase 6 — META-IMPROVE (Self-Improvement des Skills)

After all 3 loops are complete, this skill analyzes and improves **itself**. This is the meta-layer: the improvement skill improving its own improvement process.

### Step 1: Self-Analysis

Read this skill file (`~/.claude/commands/self-improve.md`) and reflect on the 3 loops that just ran:

- Which checks found nothing useful across all 3 loops? → Could they be removed or replaced?
- Was something missing that would have been useful to check?
- Were there steps that took too long or produced low-value results?
- Did any phase feel redundant or could phases be combined?
- Were there new tools, techniques, or patterns discovered during the loops that should become standard checks?

### Step 2: Line Count Check

Count the lines of this skill file:
```
wc -l ~/.claude/commands/self-improve.md
```

- If **under 350 lines**: Improvements can be suggested freely
- If **350-400 lines**: Warn the user that the limit is approaching
- If **400+ lines**: STOP. Report to the user that the limit is reached. Ask how to proceed (compress existing content? split into sub-files? remove low-value sections?)

### Step 3: Present Suggestions (NEVER auto-apply!)

Present improvement suggestions to the user in this format:

```
## Meta-Verbesserung: Vorschläge für den Skill selbst

### Vorschlag 1: [Titel]
**Was**: [Was soll geändert werden]
**Warum**: [Begründung aus den 3 Loops]
**Wo im Skill**: [Zeile/Phase die betroffen ist]

### Vorschlag 2: [Titel]
...

### Skill-Status
- Aktuelle Zeilenzahl: [N]/400
- Letzte Meta-Verbesserung: [Datum oder "erste"]

Soll ich diese Änderungen umsetzen? (Ja/Nein/Teilweise)
```

**CRITICAL**: NEVER modify this skill file without explicit user approval. Only suggest, never auto-apply.

### Step 4: Apply (only after user says yes)

If the user approves:
1. Apply the approved changes to `~/.claude/commands/self-improve.md`
2. Document exactly what changed (old → new)
3. The updated skill will be synced to GitHub in the next step

---

## After Meta-Improve: SYNC to GitHub

After all 3 loops are complete, **always sync changes to the cross-platform repo**:

1. **Copy changed files** from `~/.claude/` to `~/proggs/claude-code-setup/`:
   - `cp ~/.claude/rules/*.md ~/proggs/claude-code-setup/rules/`
   - `cp ~/.claude/agents/*.md ~/proggs/claude-code-setup/agents/`
   - `cp ~/.claude/commands/*.md ~/proggs/claude-code-setup/commands/`
   - `cp ~/.claude/hooks/auto-format.sh ~/proggs/claude-code-setup/hooks/`
   - `cp ~/CLAUDE.md ~/proggs/claude-code-setup/CLAUDE.md`
   - `cp ~/.gitignore_global ~/proggs/claude-code-setup/.gitignore_global`
   - Update `~/proggs/claude-code-setup/settings.json` (without platform-specific hooks)

2. **Check if Windows variants need updating**: If a rule, agent, or hook changed, consider whether the Windows equivalent (`hooks/auto-format.ps1`, `hooks-windows.json`) also needs to be updated to match.

3. **Commit and push** to `Pepsi1978/proggs` (NEVER create a separate repo!):
   ```
   cd ~/proggs && git add claude-code-setup/ && git commit -m "Update claude-code-setup: [brief summary]" && git push
   ```

4. **Report sync status** in the final summary.

This ensures the Windows machine always has access to the latest optimizations. Everything lives in `Pepsi1978/proggs/claude-code-setup/` — the single source of truth for both platforms.

## Final Summary

Give a final comprehensive summary:
- Total number of improvements made
- Current environment status (everything green?)
- GitHub sync status (what was pushed)
- Any recommendations that need the user's input
- Next recommended run: suggest when to run /self-improve again

## Important Rules

- NEVER create new GitHub repositories. ALL files belong in `Pepsi1978/proggs`. Always push to the existing repo, never create separate repos.
- NEVER modify this skill file without explicit user approval (Meta-Improve is suggest-only)
- NEVER downgrade the model from Opus or reduce effort level
- NEVER install Python tools for visible/GUI purposes
- NEVER remove existing working configurations without replacement
- This skill file has a **400-line limit**. If approaching, warn the user.
- **Transparency**: Every single change (file, setting, config) must be documented in the report. No silent changes.
- ALWAYS run updates that don't require user passwords automatically
- If something needs `sudo`, tell the user what to run manually
- If you find a critical security issue, report it IMMEDIATELY, don't wait for the loop to finish
- Use Agent Teams to parallelize research and updates wherever possible
- Keep the memory file under 200 lines (it gets truncated otherwise)
