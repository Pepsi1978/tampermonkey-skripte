# Workspace Scan for Codex

This scan is Codex-specific. It must not use `proggs` or Claude's whiteboard as an operational source.

## Required Scan Targets

Always inspect:
- `AGENTS.md`
- `codex-setup/README.md`
- `codex-setup/rules/global.md`
- `codex-setup/rules/self-observation.md`
- `codex-setup/rules/resilient-bugfixing.md`
- `codex-setup/rules/german-trigger-routing.md`
- `codex-setup/rules/claude-delta-sync.md`
- `codex-setup/rules/gemini-delta-sync.md`
- `codex-setup/agent-memory/shared/MEMORY.md`
- `codex-setup/scripts/`
- `codex-setup/scripts/audit-claude-delta.mjs`
- `codex-setup/scripts/audit-gemini-delta.mjs`
- `codex-setup/state/claude-delta-state.json`
- `codex-setup/state/gemini-delta-state.json`
- `codex-setup/state/environment-fixes.json`
- `codex-setup/bridges/`
- `codex-setup/bridges/directive-1-superintelligence-universal.md`
- `codex-setup/bridges/directive-2-self-observation-universal.md`
- `codex-setup/bridges/directive-3-resilient-bugfixing-universal.md`
- `codex-setup/skills/self-improve/`
- `.github/workflows/`
- `~/.codex/config.toml`
- `~/.codex/skills/self-improve/` if present

Conditional:
- `mcp-code-search/` when semantic search exists
- `~/.codex/log/` when runtime failures or startup warnings are relevant
- repo launchers or wrapper scripts when they affect Codex startup

## Required Findings

The scan must answer:
1. Does Codex have its own whiteboard in `codex-setup/`?
2. Is Codex already 100 percent operationally independent from `proggs` and Claude memory?
3. Is the self-improve skill repo-first and deployable to `~/.codex/skills/`?
4. Do the whiteboard bridge scripts exist and validate?
5. Are GitHub workflows validating `codex-setup/**`?
6. Are local MCP registrations aligned with this workspace?
7. Is the whiteboard's `## Oberste Direktive` propagated across the attached Codex control files, prompts, validation paths, and `AGENTS.md`?
8. Is `self-observation` visible as the second directive under the `## Oberste Direktive`?
9. Are the 8 intelligence dimensions and the compounding-superintelligence direction visible in the controlling Codex files?
10. Are the 6 self-observation categories visible and propagated in the controlling Codex files?
11. Does self-observation still require end-of-task reporting instead of mid-task interruption?
12. Is directive 2 mirrored in both the repo whiteboard and the deployed local self-improve skill?
13. Does directive 2 still require immediate persistence of user hints and treat repeated failures as alarms?
14. Is resilient bugfixing visible as directive 3 for environment-level fixes?
15. Is directive 3 mirrored in both the repo whiteboard and the deployed local self-improve skill?
16. Does directive 3 still require the 5 bugfix steps, the 8-point review, defense in depth, and platform-aware durability?
17. Can Claude/Cloud Code setup changes be audited without writing into Claude files?
18. Does the Claude-delta audit state cleanly track only programming-environment deltas?
19. Does `codex-setup/bridges/` expose a reusable Cloud-Code bridge spec that other CLIs can read and mirror?
20. Does Codex log environment-level fixes with enough context, symptom, cause, verification, and portability detail that other CLIs can understand them without session context?
21. Can Gemini CLI setup and memory changes be audited without writing into Gemini files?

## Forbidden Operational Sources

Do not use these as the active Codex memory or control plane:
- `~/proggs/...`
- `claude-code-setup/`
- `.claude/agent-memory/shared/MEMORY.md`
- `~/.claude/...`

They may exist in the repository, but for this skill they are not authoritative.
