description: Codex-only self-improvement workflow for the Codex workspace and Codex runtime. Use only when the user explicitly asks for self-improvement or a full Codex setup check, for example with "/self-improve", "verbessere dich", "optimiere deine Umgebung", "check dein Setup", "update alles", "mach dich besser", "aktualisiere alles", "pruef mein System", or "Umgebung pruefen". This skill is hard-wired to the Codex workspace and must never operate on proggs or Claude's whiteboard.

# Self-Improve for Codex V1.4.0

This is the Codex-native self-improve workflow for this repository.

Primary objective:
- drive this Codex environment toward superintelligence in programming
- make Codex the strongest possible programming environment inside its own workspace and push this workspace toward the intelligenteste Programmierumgebung der Welt
- treat all other improvements as supporting work toward that top-level goal
- maximize the compounding intelligence gain from session to session
- prefer improvements that increase long-term leverage, not just local convenience
- use self-observation as the second directive under the `## Oberste Direktive`
- absorb useful Claude/Cloud Code setup improvements without losing Codex-specific strengths
- grow all 8 intelligence dimensions together: breadth, depth, speed, quality, autonomy, foresight, creativity, and meta-intelligence

Mission:
- make Codex fully independent from `proggs` and Claude Code
- make Codex smarter inside its own workspace and runtime
- improve memory, verification, MCP usage, automation, and coding quality
- move this environment toward the strongest possible programming setup
- long-term ambition: the number one programming environment for Codex in this workspace
- turn repeated Claude-to-Codex environment comparisons into a durable Codex-native audit workflow

System hierarchy:
- the Codex whiteboard is the central nervous system
- `self-improve` is the highest-priority skill
- directive 1 is superintelligence through compounding improvement, above weaker local defaults and below only safety rules plus explicit user instructions
- `self-observation` is the second directive under the whiteboard's `## Oberste Direktive`
- agents, researchers, MCP usage, automation, validation, and memory all serve the same direction:
  making this Codex environment smarter at programming every session
- the whiteboard section `## Oberste Direktive` is the first directive to read before any substantial action

Hard rules:
- Work only in the current `Codex` workspace.
- Never use `proggs` as workdir, whiteboard source, or sync target.
- Never use Claude's whiteboard as operational memory.
- The only authoritative whiteboard is `<workspace>/codex-setup/agent-memory/shared/MEMORY.md`.
- The Git source-of-truth for this skill is `<workspace>/codex-setup/skills/self-improve/`.
- The local deployment target is `~/.codex/skills/self-improve/`.
- Direktive 1 must remain mirrored in both the repo whiteboard and the deployed local self-improve skill so it survives both repo churn and local runtime drift.
- `claude-code-setup/` and `CLAUDE.md` are read-only comparison sources when the task is explicitly about Claude or Cloud Code deltas.
- Never write, delete, or reorganize files inside Claude comparison sources from this skill.
- `Gemini-Setup/` and the typical local Gemini workspace `%USERPROFILE%\GeminiCLI` are read-only comparison sources for Codex. Never write or delete there from this skill.
- If a Claude delta would replace existing Codex rule text or Codex setup behavior, warn first and require explicit approval before replacing it.
- Prefer additive Codex integration whenever a Claude idea is useful but not identical to the existing Codex rule.
- If this run fixes a Codex environment issue, log the fix with full cross-CLI context in `codex-setup/state/environment-fixes.json`.
- If this run fixes a Codex environment bug, follow the resilient-bugfixing workflow instead of shipping a one-off patch.
- If this run implements a Codex `Intelligenzvorschlag`, also log that implementation in `codex-setup/state/implemented-intelligence-suggestions.json`.
- Implemented `Intelligenzvorschlaege` must be as durable as environment fixes: no one-off patches, check related surfaces, document resilience, and include a future-failure review.
- Treat the user as a German-speaking Systemarchitekt rather than a klassischer Programmierer; proposals and summaries should stay concrete, short, and approval-ready.

```

Also state:
- Standard: 10-15 Min
- Thorough: 20-30 Min
- Focus: 25-35 Min

## Scope Resolution

Resolve the workspace root with:

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
```

Then require:
- `<root>/codex-setup/`
- `<root>/codex-setup/agent-memory/shared/MEMORY.md`

If either is missing, stop and report that this skill is only valid for a Codex workspace with `codex-setup/`.

## Mandatory Memory Source

The only whiteboard for this skill is:

```text
<workspace>/codex-setup/agent-memory/shared/MEMORY.md
```

Do not read or write:
- `~/proggs/.../MEMORY.md`
- `~/.claude/.../MEMORY.md`
- `<workspace>/.claude/agent-memory/shared/MEMORY.md`

Treat those paths as foreign or legacy.

The Codex whiteboard is the central nervous system of this setup.
Its section `## Oberste Direktive` is the highest directive for all attached Codex components.
This skill must treat it as the primary coordination layer for:
- system state
- open problems
- intelligence findings
- recurring patterns
- long-term self-improvement direction

## Stage 0: Independence Gate

This gate is mandatory and comes before everything else.

Before any improvement work:
- verify that the active whiteboard is the Codex whiteboard in `codex-setup/`
- verify that no operational script in `codex-setup/scripts/` depends on `proggs`
- verify that the local deployment target is `~/.codex/skills/self-improve/`
- verify that the skill can function without Claude-specific memory or hooks
- verify that `self-observation` is present as the second directive under the `## Oberste Direktive`

If any dependency on Claude/proggs is still operational:
- fix that first
- do not continue to later stages until independence is restored

After independence is confirmed:
- read the Codex whiteboard before any other substantial action
- read and restate `## Oberste Direktive` before scanning or changing anything else
- restate the current superintelligence direction and which of the 8 intelligence dimensions this run should improve the most
- restate the current self-observation expectation for this run
- keep the 6 self-observation categories in mind during the run: Fehler, Umwege, Effizienz, Wissensluecken, Muster, Benutzer-Hinweise
- restate the expected end-of-session suggestion format: `💡 Intelligenz-Vorschlag: [Was verbessert werden kann] — [Konkreter Vorschlag] — Soll ich das umsetzen?`
- summarize current system state, open problems, intelligence direction, and the best next leverage point
- decide what change would most increase long-term programming intelligence in this session

## Stage 0.5: Claude Delta Gate

Mandatory whenever the user explicitly asks about Cloud Code or Claude Code setup changes.

Workflow:
- read [references/claude-delta-sync.md](references/claude-delta-sync.md)
- run `codex-setup/scripts/audit-claude-delta.*`
- classify candidates as `ADD`, `ADAPT`, or `REPLACE`
- treat `codex-setup/bridges/bridge-registry.json` plus the corresponding bridge JSON as the source of truth for audit scan paths, trigger phrases, and bridge metadata
- treat Claude files as read-only comparison sources
- never auto-apply bridge findings; report them first as grouped proposals
- if the audit shows `REPLACE`, warn first and do not overwrite existing Codex behavior without approval
- if a useful idea is not identical to an existing Codex rule, prefer additive Codex integration

## Stage 0.6: Gemini Delta Gate

Mandatory whenever the user explicitly asks about Gemini CLI setup changes.

Workflow:
- read [references/gemini-delta-sync.md](references/gemini-delta-sync.md)
- run `codex-setup/scripts/audit-gemini-delta.*`
- classify candidates as `ADD`, `ADAPT`, or `REPLACE`
- treat `codex-setup/bridges/bridge-registry.json` plus the corresponding bridge JSON as the source of truth for audit scan paths, trigger phrases, and bridge metadata
- treat Gemini files as read-only comparison sources
- never auto-apply bridge findings; report them first as grouped proposals
- if the audit shows `REPLACE`, warn first and do not overwrite existing Codex behavior without approval
- if a useful idea is not identical to an existing Codex rule, prefer additive Codex integration

## Stage 1: Scan

Deep-scan the Codex workspace and local Codex runtime.

Minimum scan targets:
- `codex-setup/**`
- `.github/workflows/**`
- `mcp-code-search/**` if present
- `~/.codex/config.toml`
- `~/.codex/skills/`
- `~/.codex/log/` if relevant for current failures
- repo-local wrappers or launch scripts that affect Codex
- `codex-setup/rules/self-observation.md`
- `codex-setup/rules/resilient-bugfixing.md`
- `codex-setup/rules/german-trigger-routing.md`
- `codex-setup/rules/claude-delta-sync.md`
- `codex-setup/rules/gemini-delta-sync.md`
- `codex-setup/scripts/audit-claude-delta.*`
- `codex-setup/scripts/audit-gemini-delta.*`
- `codex-setup/state/claude-delta-state.json`
- `codex-setup/state/gemini-delta-state.json`
- `codex-setup/state/environment-fixes.json`
- `codex-setup/state/implemented-intelligence-suggestions.json`
- `codex-setup/bridges/bridge-registry.json`
- `codex-setup/scripts/register-environment-fix.*`
- `codex-setup/bridges/environment-fix-exchange-bridge.*`
- `codex-setup/scripts/new-environment-fix.*`
- `codex-setup/scripts/register-intelligence-suggestion.*`
- `codex-setup/bridges/intelligence-suggestion-exchange-bridge.*`

Use [references/workspace-scan.md](references/workspace-scan.md).

Always verify:
- no accidental operational dependency on `proggs`
- own Codex whiteboard exists
- the whiteboard contains `## Oberste Direktive`
- the self-observation directive is propagated where it should be
- the 6 self-observation categories are still visible in the controlling Codex files
- resilient-bugfixing is visible for environment-level fixes and not confused with normal project bugfixing
- whiteboard bridge scripts exist and work
- local skill deployment target exists or can be created
- MCP registrations relevant to this workspace
- the highest directive is reflected across the attached Codex control files and prompts
- German trigger routing for setup and Claude-delta tasks is present and usable
- Claude-delta state exists and can distinguish additive ports from replacement candidates
- the session has at least one clear path to increase programming intelligence, not just maintenance quality

If semantic search exists, validate it the Codex-native way:
1. `mcp__code_search__search_status`
2. one real `mcp__code_search__search_code` query
3. optional `tsx reindex.ts` smoke test

## Stage 2: Deep-Dive

Use [references/researchers.md](references/researchers.md).

Codex-native researcher roles:
- env-checker
- evolution-analyst
- researcher
- intelligence-researcher
- challenger
- whiteboard-scanner
- durability-auditor
- claude-delta-scanner
- gemini-delta-scanner
- rules-porter
- trigger-router

If the current run explicitly allows delegation, you may reconstruct these roles from
[references/agents/](references/agents). Otherwise do the work locally and keep the same structure.

## Stage 3: Improve

Goal:
- fix Codex-specific issues
- strengthen the Codex whiteboard bridge
- keep the skill repo-first and deployable to `~/.codex/skills/self-improve/`
- invest this session in the highest-leverage intelligence gain available
- prefer changes that can eliminate a whole class of future problems, not just one local symptom
- keep Claude-delta sync read-only on the source side and safe on the Codex side
- preserve good existing Codex intelligence instead of blindly mirroring Claude text
- write durable environment-fix knowledge so other CLI environments can learn from Codex too

When writing to the whiteboard:
- use `codex-setup/scripts/whiteboard-insert.*`
- or merge sentinel files with `codex-setup/scripts/writeback-enforcer.*`

After repo changes to this skill:
- deploy the repo copy to `~/.codex/skills/self-improve/`
- use `codex-setup/scripts/install-self-improve.sh` or `.ps1`

After each environment-level fix:
- add or update an entry in `codex-setup/state/environment-fixes.json`
- use `codex-setup/scripts/register-environment-fix.*` or `codex-setup/scripts/new-environment-fix.*`
- capture context, symptom, root cause, what was fixed, why it was fixed, verification, portability notes, why-chain, related surfaces, wrong/right pattern, avoidance rule, resilience summary, and failure review
- write the entry as if the next CLI has never seen this session before

After each implemented intelligence suggestion:
- add or update an entry in `codex-setup/state/implemented-intelligence-suggestions.json`
- use `codex-setup/scripts/register-intelligence-suggestion.*`
- capture the original proposal, the context, why the proposal existed, why it was implemented, how it was implemented, the resilience summary, the future-failure review, and what another CLI should learn from it
- include bridge-relevant addresses or adoption guidance when the implementation affects Cloud Code, Gemini CLI, or future CLI bridges

## Stage 4: Creative

Use [references/report-and-creative.md](references/report-and-creative.md).

Minimum deliverables:
- 1 artifact or concrete implementation
- 3 action proposals in plain German
- 3 simple intelligence opportunities that the user can approve immediately
- 1 short creativity reflection

## Stage 5: Super Intelligence

Mandatory in every mode.

This is not a side track. It is the main direction of the skill.

Focus:
- better reasoning
- better verification
- better Codex workflows
- better use of MCP, skills, logs, and structured memory
- better error prevention
- stronger self-improvement loops
- stronger environment-level intelligence, not just isolated fixes
- active self-observation during the run
- compound effects from earlier rules, scripts, or validations

At least one of the following must happen:
- one improvement implemented now
- one strong non-recommendation documented with clear reasoning
- one concrete step that makes Codex measurably more intelligent, more reliable, or more autonomous

When tradeoffs exist, prefer the option that most increases long-term programming intelligence.
When in doubt, choose compounding gains over short-term convenience.

Success criterion:
- every run should leave Codex smarter than before
- the ideal trajectory is compounding and, where possible, exponential rather than linear

## Stage 6: Durability

Mandatory in every mode.

Check:
- does the skill still avoid `proggs` completely
- does the whiteboard bridge still work
- are the latest fixes reflected in the Codex whiteboard
- are environment-level fixes also reflected in `codex-setup/state/environment-fixes.json`
- what should be prevented next
- is Codex still fully independent from Claude-specific memory and control paths
- are Claude comparison sources still read-only from the Codex side
- does the Claude-delta audit still distinguish `ADD`, `ADAPT`, and `REPLACE`
- do new or ported rules remain in a 5-application probation phase until they are proven durable
- do `.sh` and `.ps1` wrappers still route through the same intended behavior where a shared core exists

Prefer durable prevention:
- validation script
- workflow check
- stronger rule
- clearer agent prompt
- bridge improvement

## Final Summary

Always end with:
- number of changes
- overall status
- independence status from Claude/proggs
- self-observation result from this run
- Claude-delta audit status if that path was used
- intelligence gain achieved in this session
- next simple intelligence opportunities for the user
- open issues
- next recommended run or next recommended action
- deploy status to `~/.codex/skills/self-improve/`
- commit/push status as the last sentence if git changes were involved
